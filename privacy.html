                            <strong> <i>Information you submit via the Services:</i></strong> Bee Translate collects personal information
                            from you when you register for access to the Services (for example email address, password, username),
                            update your profile, use certain Services, contact us with inquiries, or respond to one of our
                            surveys. <br> <strong><i>Tracking Technology:</i></strong> When you interact with Bee Translate through
                            the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable data. Such information,
                            which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically
                            identify you. Bee Translate may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases
                            owned and maintained by Bee Translate affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such
                            information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors
                            to our Services, the number of visitors to each page of our Site or game of our apps, the domain
                            names of our visitors’ Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the
                            Bee Translate Services. <br> Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the
                            Services, Bee Translate often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based
                            on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and
                            analyzed on an aggregate basis. Bee Translate may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with
                            its affiliates, agents and business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate
                            information does not identify you personally. Bee Translate may also disclose aggregated user statistics
                            in order to describe our Services to current and prospective business partners, and to other
                            third parties for other lawful purposes. <br> In addition, we store certain information from
                            your browser using "cookies". Cookies are pieces of data stored on your hard drive by a website.
                            Cookies help us make our Services and your visit better. We use cookies to see which parts of
                            our Services people use and like and to count visits to our Services.

                        <p>
                            Bee Translate is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship
                            with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data
                            with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below: <br>                            <strong><i>Business
                                    Transfers:</i></strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or
                            assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event,
                            Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. <br> <strong><i>Related Companies:</i></strong>
                            We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with
                            this Privacy Policy. <br> <strong><i>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</i></strong>
                            Bee Translate, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related
                            functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and
                            processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we
                            only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. <br>                            <strong><i>Legal
                                    Requirements:</i></strong> Bee Translate may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so
                            by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation,
                            (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Bee Translate, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to
                            protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal
                            liability.

                            We have security procedures for the storage and disclosure of personal information, which you have given us in order to prevent
